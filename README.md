# SOS Ukraine
### In the war between Russia and Ukraine, we stand with humanity.

***
In the war between Russia and Ukraine, 28000+ civilians were killed, 18000+ were injured, and uncountable lives were affected. Moreover, 50000+ Ukrainian soldiers are either killed, wounded or missing. The war between nations doesn't bring any good to anyone. After watching these civilian and military casualties, we felt that only if a system could exist which was fast, efficient and reliable enough to provide civilians and military with an emergency SOS service then the number of casualties would have been significantly less. Inspired by this vision, my colleagues and I decided to solve this problem. This project is the result of this shared vision.
